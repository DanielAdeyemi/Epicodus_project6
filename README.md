## *Setup instructions:*
#### From the web:
* Go to my GitHub repository, using following [URL](https://github.com/DanielAdeyemi/Epicodus_project6.git).
* Click the "Code" ![img](src/assets/code.png) and click the 'Download zip' option ![img](src/assets/zip.png).
* Unzip the file, navigate to the `src` directory.
* open ***'index.html' or any interesting for you file*** to see code.
#### From the terminal: 
* Clone my repository from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/DanielAdeyemi/https://github.com/DanielAdeyemi/Epicodus_project6.git`
* Navigate to the downloaded folder using ***cd*** command
* Create `.env` file in the top level of directory
* For secure use of your key (and good practice), make sure you create *.env* file in your project and also put .env file inside `.gitignore`. *(Note: commit and push new .gitignore file as soon as you created .env and updated your gitignore!)* 
* Execute **code .** command in your terminal and it will open all source code in your code editor.    
*Note: to run this project locally you will need to have Node. After you cloned and open repository - execute `npm install` in command line to gain access to webpack*
